# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
This project cleaned large amounts of data and combined multiple csv and json file types. ETL process was used to complete this project. Tables were created using Jupyter Notebook and PGAdmin. 
This project was written heavily in Python with some SQL. 
## Summary
Data form Wikepedia and Kaggle movie data was first extracted by reading the 3 files. Two CSV files and one json file. The data was then filtered out and examined to create a plan. Once all of the data was extracted from the 3 files, errors were found within the different columns. This data then needed to be cleaned, as it would have been too messy when combining data tables. Once the wiki and kaggle data frames were merged, a handful of rows did not match up. The rows were then examined individually and a plan was made as to which columns would be kept from which data frame. Dataframes were then merges and transformed. Lastly, they were loaded to create a clean, readable single file.
